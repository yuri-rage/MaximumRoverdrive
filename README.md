# MaximumRoverdrive

Uses pymavlink to select and monitor MAVlink messages of interest and display them in a "sticky" window.

In present state, MAV.ini contains some test values, and the software is not fully functional, though it does provide near real-time display of message data as defined in MAV.ini.

* TODO: finish config file IO
* TODO: allow user selectable messages (instead of test input)
* TODO: allow user to set min/max values and multipliers for display formatting
* TODO: create an interface for sending messages (like toggling relays)
